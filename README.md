# git-experiments
Repo to beat up on Git/GitHub for learning/experimentation.

Give that we are **Elixirized**, it makes the most sense that this repo contain Elixir (and related) code, but it really doesn't matter. What *does* matter is that we use this repo for experiments and other exercises to demystify the ridiculous vagaries and quirks of git and GitHub.

## First: `git revert` vs. `git reset` vs. !@#@^&%$@#&%~!! 

i.e., How to recover (at the remote [i.e., GitHub repo] *and locally*) from pushing/merging a commit that was a mistake.
